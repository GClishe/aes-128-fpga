# aes-128-fpga
AES-128 implementation in Python, C++, and FPGA RTL


The main goal is to gain practice with RTL code and FPGA implementation. The purpose of the Python portion is mainly to familiarize myself with how the algorithm actually works
beofre I try the RTL. If I end up doing a C++ implementation, the purpose there will be to gain more practice with the language itself. 

I intend for this project to be a stepping stone to more advanced FPGA projects later on. This means that I do not want to spend too much time in, for example, the Python portion
of this project. For that reason, I do not expect my version of the algorithm to be a super efficient AES128 implementation. Maybe later on I will optimize it, but for now efficiency
is not my main goal.
