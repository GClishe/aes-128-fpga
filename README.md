# aes-128-fpga
AES-128 implementation in Python, C++, and FPGA RTL


The main goal is to gain practice with RTL code and FPGA implementation. The purpose of the Python portion is mainly to familiarize myself with how the algorithm actually works
beofre I try the RTL. If I end up doing a C++ implementation, the purpose there will be to gain more practice with the language itself.
